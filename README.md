=====================
Pavan Kumar p pxp2863

Source code of my python scanner is in pxp2863_pythonScanner.
Name of the file used to give inputs to the scanner is "front.in". It should be placed in the project folder. 
Output for my program is displayed in the eclipse console output.(I configured python in eclipse) 
Place the "front.in" input file in your project folder and run the program.
For sample input: "(sum + 47)/total"  you will see below output:

Next token is:  25  Next Lexeme is:  (
Next token is:  11  Next Lexeme is:  sum
Next token is:  21  Next Lexeme is:  +
Next token is:  10  Next Lexeme is:  47
Next token is:  26  Next Lexeme is:  )
Next token is:  24  Next Lexeme is:  /
Next token is:  11  Next Lexeme is:  total
Next token is:  -1  Next Lexeme is:  EOF
